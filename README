Chad's project to simulate a queue at a grocery store using threads and queues in a program. Will have a visual aid in the form of a gui where the user will be able to start, pause and set variables. I was not able to finish the project, which is really upsetting to me. I had a good start on the project in the beginning, but I had some personal issues arise and was not able to properly focus on the program as well as I should have. I have the model working well (I think) but was not able to get the view anywhere near what I wanted.
